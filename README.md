Activity 3: 
SQL databases store data in tables, with a fixed number of columns and varying number of rows. NoSQL databases are instead organized as "collections" rather than tables of records. NoSQL databases list the users with their role_id, and allow for faster querying with the expense that a role name must be stored with each user. While SQL databases are good for storing structured data, NoSQL databases are more relaxed and are sometimes better in performance.
